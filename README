To send mail in Node.js using OAuth2 authentication, you can follow these steps:

Set up OAuth2 credentials:

    -> Create a project on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) console.
    -> Enable the Gmail API for the project.
    -> Create OAuth2 credentials (client ID and client secret) for your application.
    -> Set the authorized redirect URI(s) for your application.
    -> Obtain the client ID and client secret.
    -> Install the required dependencies:

Install the nodemailer and googleapis packages using npm or yarn:

    >>>npm install nodemailer googleapis


Note: The code assumes that you have already obtained the access token (YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN) through the OAuth2 authentication process. If you don't have an access token, you can follow the OAuth2 authorization flow to obtain it.
